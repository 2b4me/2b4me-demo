CONTEST OVERVIEW

Users sign up. Numbers are assigned to all users. Once a week, until the contest is over, we will have a drawing and select first, second and third place winners (via number) for each prize to be awarded that week. First place winning numbers will be published on the main site. If a first place winner is found to be ineligible, the corresponding second place winner will be contacted. If the second place winner is found to be ineligible, the corresponding third place winner will be contacted. If the third place winner is found to be ineligible, three new winners (first, second and third place) will be selected. The process repeats itself until all prizes for the week are awarded. 


HOW CONTEST APPLICANTS GET ASSIGNED A NUMBER

Numbers are preassigned using the following algorithm:

1. Create a java.util.Random object (r) with seed 2746.
2. Create an array to hold generated values.
3. Repeatedly call r.nextInt(10000) and store all unique values in an array until the array reached 10000 elements (all possible values between 00000 and 09999).
4. Rename 00000 to 10000.
5. Print the array to a file (numbers.txt).

The numbers will be assigned to signups in order of sign up, kept in 2b4me Launch Promotion spreadsheet in Google Drive. This is irrespective to contest eligibility. This way we can ensure contest number assignment is fair for all participants.
